# An Interactive Essay on the Art of Interface Architecture

This interactive essay is my attempt to pool years worth of knowledge from both my work in cognitive science and the applied engineering I have completed in industry. I think UI design and development, font end development, design systems, etc. are really meant to co-exist under the umbrella concept of user interface architecture and I explain that here, with technioques and examples from my own career.
